Approach: XOR a and b, and count the number of set bits.

Original c-like pseudocode:

    int bits(int a, int b)
    {
        diff = a ^ b;
        count = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < 8 * sizeof(diff); i++) {
            if (diff & (1 << i))
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

## Lessons

1. Pay attention to examples. I would have been done even sooner if I hadn't let the wording of the question confuse me.
