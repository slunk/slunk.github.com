prompt: "How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time."

Approach: store the current minimum value in the stack along with the element being added.

Original c-like pseudocode:

    struct entry {
        int val;
        int min;
    }

    struct stack {
        entry *arr;
        int sz;
        int ptr;
    }

    void push(stack *skt, int val)
    {
        if (stk->sz > stk->ptr) {
            stk->arr[ptr].val = val; // Minor error here
            stk->arr[ptr].min = min_helper(stk, val);
            // Forgot to increment stk->ptr here
        } else {
            error();
        }
    }

    int pop(stack *stk)
    {
        if (stk->ptr <= 0)
            error();
        return stk->arr[--stk->ptr].val;
    }

    int min(stack *stk)
    {
        if (stk->ptr <= 0)
            error();
        return stk->ptr[stk->ptr - 1].min;
    }

    int min_helper(stack *stk, int val)
    {
        int last;
        if (stk->ptr == 0)
            return val;
        last = stk->arr[stk->ptr - 1].min;
        return val < last ? val : last;
    }

## Lessons

1. Always test by hand. Forgetting to increment the stack pointer is an easy mistake to make but I should have caught it.
