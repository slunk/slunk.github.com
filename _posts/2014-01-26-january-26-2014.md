prompt: "Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (i.e., if you have a tree with depth D, youâ€™ll have D linked lists)."

Approach: do a breadth first search through the tree keeping track of the depth as an index into an array of linked lists.

Original c-like pseudocode:

    void depth_lists(tree *t, linked_lists **lls)
    {
        nodeq.enq(t->root);
        depthq.enq(0);
        while (!nodeq.empty()) {
            curr = nodeq.deq();
            depth = depthq.deq();
            lls[depth].add(curr);
            nodeq.enq(left); // Error: Should have checked if children were present
            nodeq.enq(right);
            depthq.enq(depth + 1);
            depthq.enq(depth + 1);
        }
    }

## Lessons

1. Once again, test the code by hand and figure out edge cases before doing so. I did some cursory testing, but didn't check what happened at leaf nodes.
2. The actual implementation was much more complicated than the pen and paper one. I should have data structure implementations on hand so I don't always have to re-qrite them if I use C.
